// Write a single test for our archive tasks function. The test should take a sample input and
// start time, pass it to the function under test, and check that the returned input matches
// the expected output.
//
// We're using Jest as our test runner, so I recommend using `describe()` and `it()` to wrap the
// test.
//
// We're going to use a TDD approach, so we'll write the test before the code.
//
// You can check that everything is working by running `yarn test src/ex012/archive-tasks.test.ts`.
// If you have not yet written the function, then the test should fail. If you _have_ written the
// function, then the test should pass.
