// Take your test code from ex01 and expand it to add two more examples. You may find using Jest's
// `describe.each()` function handy here.
// [Link to Jest describe.each() API](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#2-describeeachtablename-fn-timeout)
//
// What values you put in the examples are entirely up to you. But, each test case needs a sample
// input value, and an expected output value. It may be a good idea to include a description
// column in your table too, so that you can tell which test fails.
